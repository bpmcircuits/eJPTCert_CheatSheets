## Vulnerabilities

A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found
in software and hardware components that, when
exploited, results in a negative impact to
confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

CVE - Common Vulnerabilites and Exposure (Maintained by US Department of Homeland Security)

NVD - National Vulnerabilities Database (Maintained by NIST)

CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

**Vuln Examples:**

CVE-2021-44228 - Apache LOG4J

CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed Vuln

CVE-2017-0143 - Eternal Blue


### Zero Day

A zero-day (also known as a 0-day) is a vulnerability or security hole in a computer system unknown to its owners, developers or anyone capable of mitigating it. Until the vulnerability is remedied, threat actors can exploit it in a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.

### How to find vulns

- Scanning
- Asset Identification + Research
- Fuzz Testing (input/handling validation)

## Case Studies

### CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed Vuln

TLS, OpenSSL, Buffer over-read

**nmap:**

- *nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443* target

Dedicated script: 

- *nmap -sV --script ssl-heartbleed* target

**Tips:**

- Look for nmap scripts, exploit database, etc. for existing proof of concepts

### CVE-2017-0143 - Eternal Blue
