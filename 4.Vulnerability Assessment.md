## Vulnerabilities

A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found
in software and hardware components that, when
exploited, results in a negative impact to
confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

CVE - Common Vulnerabilites and Exposure (Maintained by US Department of Homeland Security)

NVD - National Vulnerabilities Database (Maintained by NIST)

CIA Triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

**Vuln Examples:**

CVE-2021-44228 - Apache LOG4J

CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed Vuln

CVE-2017-0143 - Eternal Blue


### Zero Day

A zero-day (also known as a 0-day) is a vulnerability or security hole in a computer system unknown to its owners, developers or anyone capable of mitigating it. Until the vulnerability is remedied, threat actors can exploit it in a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.

### How to find vulns

- Scanning
- Asset Identification + Research
- Fuzz Testing (input/handling validation)

- Look for nmap scripts, exploit database, etc. for existing proof of concepts

## Case Studies

### CVE-2014-0160 - Heartbleed Vuln

> Heartbleed is a security bug in some outdated versions of the OpenSSL cryptography library, which is a widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed could be exploited regardless of whether the vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It resulted from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension. Thus, the bug's name derived from heartbeat. The vulnerability was classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.

**Keywords:**

TLS, OpenSSL, Buffer over-read

**nmap:**

        > nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 target

Dedicated script: 

        > nmap -sV --script ssl-heartbleed target

### CVE-2017-0143 - Eternal Blue

> EternalBlue is a computer exploit developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). It was based on a vulnerability in Microsoft networking software that the NSA had known about for several years but had not disclosed to Microsoft. When the NSA discovered in 2017 that the exploit was stolen, Microsoft was informed and released security patches in March 2017. The Shadow Brokers hacker group publicly released EternalBlue on April 14, 2017.

**Keywords:**

SMBv1, Windows 7 SP 1, Windows Server 2012, Buffer Overflow, RCE

**nmap:**

Dedicated script: 

        > nmap -p 445 -sV --script smb-sm17-010 target

- msfconsole 
        > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms_17_010

### CVE-2021-44228 - Apache LOG4J

> Apache Log4j, a widely used logging library for Java, has been the subject of critical security vulnerabilities identified by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries. One of the most notable is CVE-2021-44228, dubbed "Log4Shell," which is a remote code execution vulnerability. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a server running the vulnerable Log4j version by crafting malicious input to the Log4j logging system. This vulnerability is particularly severe due to the widespread use of Log4j in applications and services across the internet, prompting urgent updates and mitigation efforts from organizations worldwide. Other CVEs have also been identified for Log4j, addressing different vulnerabilities, but Log4Shell remains the most impactful.

**Keywords:**

Log4j2, 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1, 2.13.0 through 2.15.0, RCE
